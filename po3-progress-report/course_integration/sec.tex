\section{Course Integration}
This project focuses on Informatics, but of course Mathematics is always present.
\subsection{Informatics}
We make use of Informatics to design the architecture of our application and to write our
software. This course has helped us to design our data models and to think about how
functionality should be divided into logical parts (classes).
\subsection{Mathematics}
\subsubsection{Statistics}
To analyse our measured data we make use of Statistics. This also helps to take
measuring errors into account.
\subsubsection{Numerical Mathematics}
All measured values are liable to measuring errors. These errors influence all further
calculations. Luckily our data does not need to be super exact. Our GPS data for example
only has to be closely to a few meters.
